# E-Commerce-Products

AS A warehouse manager  
I WANT a website that keeps track of our current inventory of products  
SO THAT WE can update our inventory amounts based on product sales.  
Along with allowing the users(sales team or management) to create new accounts  
for team members and create/delete new/existing products listed on the site  
As a User  
I WANT to search certain products  
SO THAT I can check inventory/availability of that specific product
